        <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                My name is <strong>Randy Limon</strong> and I am a student at
                <strong>Northern Arizona University</strong> and currently I am
                majoring in Software Engineering as well as minoring in 
                Japanese. I do not have much of a professional 
                background as I am in school full time, though, I have many 
                interests thanks to my ADHD.<br>
                <br>

                <strong>A few exampes of such interests are:</strong><br>

                <em>
                    Custom Computers<br>
                    Custom Keyboards<br>
                    Cars<br>
                    Music<br>
                    Coding<br>
                </em>

                <br>
                The most professional business I am involved in is fronting for my meal band
                and having to communicate with venues for gig opportunities. Though, this is
                very casual compared to the professional bands and their official communications.

            <h2>Skills</h2>

            <p>
                There are many skills that I aquired through the interests that I have gotten 
                into. Many of these skills are related as the interests usually flow into one
                another and help reinforce each other. Let's explore some of the skills I have 
                aquired by going through a few of the interests listed earlier.

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>
                I have put much of my time into coding projects, many of which
                have been assigned by various calsses I have taken, but I will
                present those that I have taken on through personal interest. 
            </p>

            <h3>Text Based RPG - <em>Python</em></h3>

            <p>
                This project was started when I was approaching an intermediate
                level in the language, but before I was introduced to the idea 
                of object oriented programing. This creared many obstacles in 
                the development including, but not limited to: <br>
                <br>
                <em>
                    Town Tracking<br>
                    Inventory Tracking<br>
                    Cell Tracking<br>
                    Player Tracking<br>
                </em><br>

                This was also before I was made aware of enumerations which 
                would have helped enormously with task selection.
            </p>

            <h3>Sorting Algorithm Visualizer - <em>Python</em></h3>

            <p>
                This project started as a comparison of different sorting
                algorithms purly from the console, but quickly evolved into the
                project it became. I spent many late nights staring at my screen
                as the implementation of the visual element through pygame was
                not easy when it came to the merge sort. This project suffered
                from the lack of object oriented programing.
            </p>

            <h3>Vector Average/Sum - <em>C</em></h3>

            <p>
                I started this one with the goal of implementing the sum of 
                vectors and accidentally ended up with the averages before
                correcting and saving both versons. This project lead to me
                discovering the <strong>atan2</strong> function that is used
                a lot in 2d game development.
